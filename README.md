# 2bTetrio

This is not finished.

Node.js discord bot thingy

The original intent was for this bot to live in https://discord.gg/gDmbRZYXFW and serve as a way for players to track their statistics on Tetr.io.

It interfaces with the Tetr.io API, and returns user information accordingly.



This was the OLD TODO:
============================================================
What currently works:

  -info
    what it does: 
      -Displays information about the user provided. (W/L/Played Ratio,
         and count, name, link, country flag, rank, pfp, more to come)


  
What is ACTIVELY under development:
  
  -user handler
    what it does:
      -nothing at the user level.
      -Allows me to implement newer features that utilize the tetrio api
       10x quicker than currently do-able
  -link
    what it does:
      -A way for you to link your tetrio account to your discord account
       via the bot


Soon to be worked on:
  -Embeds changing colors to tetrio blocks    
    What it does:
      -will change all of the embed messages colors (on the left side)
        to the colors of the tetris blocks randomly. (it looks neat)
  -More info on "info" command.
